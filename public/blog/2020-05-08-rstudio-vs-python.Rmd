```{R}
#Using RStudio to index
x <- "dog"
x

#Using RStudio to create lists
y <- list (1, 3, 5) #creating vector is only applicable to R
print(y)
z <- list("a","b","c")
print(z)

#Using RStudio to extract elements from lists
y[1] #notice in R counting starts at 1
z[3]

#Creating ranges in RStudio
list <- c(1:5)
list #notice the last element is 5.

#Grabbing even numbers in RStudio
list[lapply(list, "%%", 2) == 0]

```

```{python}
#Using Python to print
print (r.x)

#Using Python to create lists
list1 =[1,3,5]
list1
list2=['a','b','c']
list2

#Using Python to extract elements from lists
list1[0] #notice in Python counting starts at 0 
list2[2]

#Creating ranges in Python
plist= list(range(5))
plist #notice the last element is number 4 not 5. 

#Grabbing odd number from 1 to 5
plist[0:6:2]
